This is the sample application of the Adobe Developers of Greater Orlando.

INSTRUCTIONS
The flex application currently depends on the webserive cfc being available at 
http://localhost/services/. The Flex application should be runnable from 
anywhere. The ColdFusion side does not use a database, but instead has one 
simulated in the factory.

TESTING
The flex side uses FlexUnit for testing, while the ColdFusion side uses CFUnit.
Tests are in matching packages in their respective packages.
