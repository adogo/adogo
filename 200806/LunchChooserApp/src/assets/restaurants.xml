It's one of the few places we can recommend the veggie burger, with a batch of crisp, skinny fries. Some patrons come just for the mashed potatoes, but we prefer them with a slice of their prime rib or a grilled steak. Kids love the tempura-battered chicken fingers. Linger over a cappuccino, but not too long---the next wave of diners is patiently waiting for your table.]]></description>
